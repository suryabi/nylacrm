2. Team Hierarchy (reporting structure, territory-based access)
3. Dashboard & Reports (Sales Overview, Revenue Report, Target Reports, Performance Reports)
4. Activity Tracking (calls, meetings, notes, follow-ups)
5. Sales Targets (territory and SKU based planning)
6. COGS Calculator
7. Proposal Generator with customizable templates

## What's Been Implemented

### Feb 19, 2026
- **BUG FIX**: Lead creation form now validates region field properly
  - Root cause: Form used `user.territory` ("All India") which backend rejected
  - Fix: Added `getInitialRegion()` validation + frontend required field checks
  - Status: VERIFIED - All tests passed

- **BUG FIX**: Lead Discovery import not saving leads
  - Root cause: Silent failures in import loop, no per-item error handling
  - Fix: Added individual error tracking, accurate success/failure counts
  - Added "Re-import All" feature for updating existing leads
  - Status: VERIFIED - MTR lead imported successfully

### Previous Session (from handoff)
- Resolved critical Babel/dev server error (craco.config.js fix)
- Dashboard navigation overhaul (single dropdown menu)
- Created SKU Performance and Resource Performance pages (MOCK DATA)
- Redesigned Sales Overview page (chart-less, card-based)
- Standardized SKUs and Partner-Sales role logic
- Fixed CORS configuration for deployment
