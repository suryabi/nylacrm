# Nyla Air & Water — Multi-Tenant CRM (PRD)

## Original problem statement (verbatim intent)
Production QC tracking, dynamic Distributor & Warehouse configuration, automated settlement generation, detailed reporting. Recent emphasis:
- New Marketing Requests workflow (Sales → Marketing → Delivery/Production) with versioned uploads, lead-time gating, distinct work queues.
- Geo-fenced "I am here" check-ins for Sales Reps.
- Zoho Books full-cycle: gated by Billed-by-Company vs Distributor; CN push deferred until applied to a delivery (India GST compliance).

## Stack
React + FastAPI + MongoDB (multi-tenant). Object storage via Emergent integration. Emergent LLM key for AI features. Zoho Books OAuth integration.

## Test credentials (see /app/memory/test_credentials.md)

## What's implemented (changelog)

### 2026-05-29 — Revenue Analytics: gross revenue + more appealing bars ✅ DONE
- **Request**: Show GROSS revenue (instead of net) across Revenue Analytics; make the bars more appealing.
- **Backend** (`routes/revenue_analytics.py`): `_aggregate` now sorts groups by gross; `revenue-compare` now computes a_revenue/b_revenue/delta/delta_pct and period totals from **gross** (was net). Breakdown endpoint still returns both `total_gross` + `total_revenue`(net) and per-group `gross`+`revenue`.
- **Frontend** (`RevenueAnalytics.js`): headline metric switched to gross — KPI "Gross Revenue" (Net shown as sub), bar chart + donut ("Gross Total") + table primary column + share% all use gross; Net kept as secondary table column. Bars restyled: teal→emerald `linearGradient` fill, 6px rounded corners, subtle muted `background` track, and `LabelList` value labels on the breakdown chart; Compare chart uses gradient rounded bars (slate A / teal-emerald B), rounded `cornerRadius` donut.
- **Verified (preview)**: gross headlined on both tabs, bars look polished in light & dark; backend tests `test_iteration_189` pass (13/1 skip); lint clean. data-testids unchanged.
- **⚠️ Action**: redeploy.


- **Request**: Redesign Revenue Analytics with contemporary styling + beautiful charts; seen by investors & whole company — must feel amazing. **Follow-up**: make it seamlessly match the overall app color/font theme and be minimalistic.
- **Final design (theme-matched)**: Rebuilt `/app/frontend/src/pages/RevenueAnalytics.js` using the app's own design system — shadcn `Card`/`Tabs`/`Select`, theme tokens (`bg-card`, `text-foreground`, `text-muted-foreground`, `border-border`, `hsl(var(--border))`, `hsl(var(--muted))`), Inter body + Plus Jakarta Sans headings (`font-heading`), and the app's emerald/teal palette (bars `#0d9488`, donut emerald/teal series, green/rose deltas). Clean white (light) / dark cards, minimal KPI cards with teal/emerald/slate icon chips, compact ₹ axis (K/L/Cr), theme-aware tooltip. Removed the earlier gold/dark-terminal styling and custom Fontshare fonts (reverted index.html).
- **Adapts to both light & dark mode** automatically (verified in both). Same endpoints + same data-testids → functionality identical to the tested version.
- **Verified (preview)**: both tabs render with live data in light AND dark mode; dropdowns work; group-by/time filters refetch; donut center total; MoM compare. Lint clean, no console errors.
- **⚠️ Action**: redeploy to see it in production.


### 2026-05-29 — Bug fix: Account-detail "Invoice Summary" showed no invoices (linkage + timezone) ✅ DONE
- **Reported (PRODUCTION)**: Account-detail "Invoice Summary (This Month)" showed "No invoices found" even though the invoices existed and appeared on the global Invoices page (e.g., accounts ITLU-HYD-A26-002, VARM-HYD-A26-001 / "Varma Steels Pvt Ltd", INV-000818).
- **Root cause**: Invoices synced from Zoho / matched to leads did NOT carry the stable CRM `account_id`/`account_uuid` (`match_invoice_to_lead` set only `lead_uuid`/`ca_lead_id`). The account-detail query's name fallback then failed because the Zoho name format differed from the CRM account name ("Pvt Ltd" vs "Private Limited"). Secondary: the `this_month` window was computed in UTC, not the tenant timezone (IST), which hides current-month invoices near month boundaries (not the cause here, but fixed).
- **User directive**: match invoices to accounts by **Account ID**, never by names (names change).
- **Fixes**:
  - `routes/accounts.py`: new admin endpoint `POST /api/accounts/relink-invoices?dry_run=` — backfills the stable `account_uuid` + `account_id` onto invoices using ID keys (existing account id/uuid → Zoho customer id ↔ account.zoho_contact_id → lead link), with a **one-time normalized-name fallback** (`_norm_company_name`, unique-match only) to BOOTSTRAP the IDs onto legacy invoices. Reports updated / already_linked / unresolved / ambiguous + by-key breakdown. Idempotent.
  - `server.py`: `match_invoice_to_lead` now also stamps `account_uuid`/`account_id` from the lead's linked account (forward-fix). Account-invoices `this_month`/`this_week`/etc. windows now computed in the tenant timezone (default Asia/Kolkata), mirroring server.py:5189.
  - Frontend: `components/InvoiceRelinkTool.jsx` — admin "Relink Invoices to Accounts" card (Preview → Apply) in Tenant Settings → Settings; `accountsAPI.relinkInvoices` in utils/api.js.
- **Verified**: preview end-to-end — a name-mismatched invoice (no CRM id) was invisible on its account page; after relink (matched via `name_normalized`) it became visible and carried the stable IDs. Tests: `tests/test_iteration_191_account_invoices_this_month_tz.py`, `tests/test_iteration_192_relink_invoices.py` (all pass).
- **⚠️ Action for user**: REDEPLOY, then Tenant Settings → Settings → "Relink Invoices to Accounts" → Preview → Apply. Any `unresolved` invoices have no ID/name link and need their Zoho-customer mapping fixed (ties to the duplicate-customer fix).


### 2026-05-29 — Bug fix: Activating an account with a manually-mapped Zoho ID created a DUPLICATE Zoho customer ✅ DONE
- **Problem (PRODUCTION)**: When an account already had a `zoho_contact_id` mapped manually (via "Link Zoho Customer"), activating it should re-sync that contact — but it created a brand-new Zoho Books customer instead.
- **Root cause**: `services/zoho_service.py:upsert_contact()` searched Zoho only by email → then by exact contact_name. When neither matched (the mapped contact's email/name differed from the account's), `existing` stayed `None` and the function fell through to `POST /contacts` (create). It never consulted the account's already-stored `zoho_contact_id`.
- **Fix**: Added a step-0 short-circuit at the top of `upsert_contact` — if `account.zoho_contact_id` is non-empty, set `existing = {contact_id: <mapped_id>}` and skip the email/name search entirely, so the function does a `PUT /contacts/{mapped_id}` (re-sync) and NEVER a create. Email search guarded with `and not existing`. Fix is centralized so all 3 callers (activation + 2 edit/resync paths in `routes/accounts.py`) benefit.
- **Verified**: `/app/backend/tests/test_iteration_190_zoho_mapped_contact_resync.py` (3/3 pass, Zoho HTTP layer mocked): mapped id → single PUT, no POST, no search GET; no-mapped-id + no match → still creates (unchanged); no-mapped-id + email match → updates found contact.
- **⚠️ Action**: this change must be REDEPLOYED to production by the user to take effect there (preview has no live Zoho OAuth connection).


### 2026-05-29 — Revenue Analytics Dashboard (recharts) ✅ DONE
- **Need**: Executives wanted a visual dashboard to slice invoice revenue by dimension and compare months.
- **Backend** (`/app/backend/routes/revenue_analytics.py`, mounted in `routes/__init__.py` WITHOUT prefix → routes live at `/api/reports/*`):
  - `GET /api/reports/revenue-analytics?time_filter=&group_by=&from_date=&to_date=&top_n=` — grouped revenue for one window. `group_by ∈ city | state | territory | business_category | sku`. `time_filter ∈ this_week | last_week | this_month | last_month | this_quarter | this_year | last_year | all_time | custom` (custom requires from/to → 400 otherwise). Returns `{from, to, time_filter, group_by, groups:[{label, revenue(net), gross, count}], raw_group_count, total_revenue, total_gross, total_invoice_count}`. Tail beyond `top_n` (default 15, max 200) rolls into an "Others" bucket.
  - `GET /api/reports/revenue-compare?period_a_year=&period_a_month=&period_b_year=&period_b_month=&group_by=&top_n=` — month-over-month. Returns `{period_a, period_b, delta, delta_pct, rows:[{label, a_revenue, b_revenue, delta, delta_pct}]}`. Invalid month → 422.
  - **Consistency**: uses `get_tenant_db()` (auto tenant-scope) + the same `_gross/_net` readers and invoice→account matching as the Account-Performance report, so `total_revenue` reconciles exactly with that report's net total (verified: ₹66,227 all-time).
- **Frontend** (`/app/frontend/src/pages/RevenueAnalytics.js`, route `/revenue-analytics`): two tabs — **Breakdown** (group-by + time-period filters; Net Revenue / Invoices / Groups stat cards; horizontal bar chart + donut share + ranked table; default = City × This Month) and **Compare Months** (Period A vs B month/year selectors + group-by; two period totals + MoM Change card green/red; paired bar chart + delta table). Built with `recharts`.
- **Permission gating** (per user: "controlled by Tenant settings, Role module access for each role"): new module key `report_revenue_analytics` added to `models/role.py` (`DEFAULT_MODULE_PERMISSIONS` default view:True, `MODULE_CATEGORIES['Reports']`, `MODULE_LABELS`). Sidebar entry under Dashboard → Reports submenu (`DashboardLayout.js`), route guarded by `ProtectedRoute moduleKey="report_revenue_analytics"`, tenant-level toggle added to Tenant Settings → Modules → Dashboard Reports, and a per-role checkbox auto-renders under Tenant Settings → Roles → Reports.
- **Verified**: testing agent iteration 189 — backend 22/22 pytest pass (1 skip), frontend 100% (both tabs, dropdown refetch, custom dates, compare deltas, sidebar nav, tenant/role plumbing). Tests: `/app/backend/tests/test_iteration_189_revenue_analytics.py` (+ `_extra.py`).


### 2026-05-27 — Admin → Batch Genealogy ✅ DONE
- **Need**: FSSAI traceability + product recall scenarios. Pick any production batch, see its full lineage: Origin → Factory warehouse arrivals → Distributor shipments (Stock In) → Inter-warehouse Stock Transfers → Customer Deliveries (Stock Out) → Current resting stock → Mass balance reconciliation.
- **Backend** (`/app/backend/routes/admin_batch_genealogy.py`, mounted at `/api/admin/batches/*`):
  - `GET /search?q&limit` — paginated list of production batches by `batch_code` / `sku_name` (regex-escaped, case-insensitive).
  - `GET /{batch_id}/genealogy` — returns `{batch, timeline, resting_stock, mass_balance}`. Timeline merges & sorts events from `warehouse_transfers`, `distributor_shipment_items`+`distributor_shipments`, `distributor_stock_transfers.items[]`, `distributor_delivery_items`+`distributor_deliveries`. Resting computed batch-aware (factory derived = arrivals − shipments out, distributor read from `distributor_stock` directly since it's batch-keyed). Mass balance surfaces drift = (transferred_to_warehouse − delivered_to_customers) − currently_resting.
  - Admin-only (`CEO`, `Director`, `Admin`, `System Admin`) — distributors and other roles get 403. Tenant-scoped.
- **Frontend** (`/app/frontend/src/pages/BatchGenealogy.js`):
  - Route `/admin/batch-genealogy` → searchable batch picker (debounced 250ms).
  - Route `/admin/batch-genealogy/:batchId` → detail view with batch header card, mass-balance card (Reconciled / Drift badge), gradient-iconed timeline, and resting-stock list per location.
  - Sidebar entry "Batch Genealogy" added under Admin module → Product & SKU group (icon: `Layers`).
- **Verified**: 10/10 backend pytest pass (`tests/test_iteration_178_batch_genealogy.py`); Playwright E2E confirms search → click-through → detail render → back navigation; admin gating verified (Distributor role gets 403 on both endpoints).


### 2026-05-29 — Phase 2 Batch Tracking: Stock IN + Stock OUT ✅ DONE
- **Scope**: Extend batch tracking from Stock Transfers (Phase 1) to `create_shipment` (Stock In) and `create_delivery` (Stock Out). User chose **strict block** validation (consistent with Stock Transfers).
- **Backend** (`/app/backend/models/distributor.py` + `routes/distributors.py`):
  - `ShipmentItemCreate` and `DeliveryItemCreate` now carry optional `batch_id`, `batch_code`.
  - `create_shipment`: when source factory warehouse has `track_batches=True`, every line MUST have `batch_id` — returns HTTP 400 with a friendly list of missing SKU names. Shipment items persist `batch_id` + `batch_code`.
  - `confirm_shipment`: stock check + deduction now keyed on `(sku_id, batch_id)` when source tracks batches — per-batch insufficiency raises 400 with batch_code in the message.
  - `mark_shipment_delivered` + `_apply_stock_on_delivery`: destination `distributor_stock` row is keyed on `(loc, sku, batch_id)`; batched stock and legacy aggregate rows stay cleanly separated.
  - `create_delivery`: when source distributor location has `track_batches=True`, every line MUST have `batch_id`. Delivery items persist `batch_id` + `batch_code`.
  - `complete_delivery`: deducts from the specific batch row (or legacy aggregate when no batch_id).
- **Backend support**: `GET /production/factory-warehouses` now exposes `track_batches` so the Stock In modal can decide whether to show the batch picker without an extra fetch.
- **Frontend** (`/app/frontend/src/pages/DistributorDetail.js` + `components/distributor/{ShipmentsTab,DeliveriesTab}.jsx`):
  - Two new state maps: `shipmentBatchesBySku`, `deliveryBatchesBySku`. Effects fetch the FIFO batch list from `/distributor/stock-transfers/batches-available` whenever a tracked source + an item's SKU is set.
  - Both modals show a per-line **"Batch * FIFO"** dropdown with options `BATCH_CODE — N units · YYYY-MM-DD`, gated on `sourceTracksBatches`. Inline error if no batches available for that SKU at source.
  - Submit payloads now carry `batch_id` and `batch_code` on every item.
  - `addShipmentItem` and `addDeliveryItem` seed `batch_id: ''`, `batch_code: ''`.
- **Verified end-to-end via curl**:
  - **Stock OUT** (Brian Hyderabad location with track_batches=true, batches A=150, B=300): no-batch payload → HTTP 400 ("Warehouse 'Hyderabad' tracks batches — please pick a production batch for…"); valid-batch payload → 200, item persisted with batch metadata, complete-delivery deducted from batch A specifically (150 → 90), batch B untouched.
  - **Stock IN** (Default master factory with track_batches=true, batches BATCH-VERIFY-A=60, B=240): no-batch payload → HTTP 400; valid-batch payload → 200, item persisted, confirm-shipment deducted factory batch A (60 → 36), deliver-shipment created destination `distributor_stock` row carrying `batch_code=BATCH-VERIFY-A-001` qty=24.
- **Test data cleaned up post-verification.**



### 2026-05-29 — Bulk re-link tool for orphan SKU pricing ✅ DONE
- **Need**: Production has hundreds of accounts. Opening each one to manually re-link an orphan SKU pricing row is impractical. Admin asked for a single screen that lists every distinct orphan name once with a dropdown to pick the target SKU and applies the relink across every affected Account / Lead / Sampling Trial in one click.
- **Backend** (`/app/backend/routes/admin_sku_migration.py`):
  - `GET /api/admin/migrations/sku/orphan-pricing` — scans `accounts.sku_pricing[]`, `leads.proposed_sku_pricing[]`, and `sampling_trials.sku_plans[]` in one pass, groups orphan entries (no `sku_id`, stored name not in current `master_skus.sku_name` set) by their stored name. Returns one row per distinct orphan name with `account_rows`, `lead_rows`, `sampling_rows` counts plus sample reference names (up to 5 each). Also returns the full `master_skus` list for the dropdown picker. Tenant-scoped, admin-only.
  - `POST /api/admin/migrations/sku/bulk-relink` — body `{mappings: [{stored_name, target_sku_id}, ...]}`. Walks each of the 3 collections once; for each orphan entry whose stored name matches a mapping (case-insensitive), sets `sku_id` to the target and refreshes the `sku` field to the target SKU's current name. Idempotent. Returns per-mapping counts.
- **Frontend** (`/app/frontend/src/pages/SkuRelinkTool.js`, new):
  - Route `/sku-management/relink` — table of orphans, filter input, per-row target-SKU dropdown, single "Apply re-links" button.
  - Each row shows: warning icon + stored name in highlighted code block, account/lead/sampling row counts, sample reference names, dropdown of all current master SKUs (with category hint).
  - Apply button shows `(N)` of picks, disabled until at least one pick is made, confirm dialog, toast on success, auto-refreshes list.
- **Entry point**: New "Re-link orphans" button next to "Sync SKU names" in SKU Management header (testid `open-relink-tool-btn`).
- **Verified end-to-end**: Seeded 2 orphan rows (1 account, 1 lead) → tool listed them with counts and sample references → applied bulk relink → re-fetch showed 0 orphans → restored test data.



### 2026-05-29 — Architectural fix: Account & Lead SKU Pricing now key on `sku_id` ✅ DONE
- **Real complaint**: After yesterday's "Sync SKU names", the user noticed the SKU pricing rows on Accounts (and the proposed pricing on Leads) STILL showed the old labels and didn't surface in Stock Out dropdowns. Root cause exposed by inspection: `accounts.sku_pricing[]` and `leads.proposed_sku_pricing[]` stored ONLY the SKU name (`sku` field) with **no `sku_id`**. So once the master name changes, those rows are orphans — there's no stable key to join on.
- **Fix #1 — schema upgrade**: Added `sku_id: Optional[str]` to `AccountSKUPricing` (both `routes/accounts.py` and `server.py` model). Lead → Account conversion now carries `sku_id` through.
- **Fix #2 — frontend pickers** (`/app/frontend/src/pages/AccountDetail.js` + `pages/LeadDetail.js`):
  - Both `<Select>`s now key on `sku_id` (option value = `sku.id`, not `sku.sku_name`).
  - `handleSKUChange` writes `sku_id` AND mirrors current `sku_name` to the legacy `sku` field so server-side code that still reads `sku` keeps working.
  - Each row shows the **resolved current name** looked up by `sku_id` (not the stored snapshot). Rows that have a stored name with no `sku_id` AND no matching current SKU are flagged inline with **"⚠ re-link"** — a clear signal to the user that this row was orphaned by a past rename and needs picking from the dropdown again.
- **Fix #3 — extended migration** (`/app/backend/routes/admin_sku_migration.py`): `POST /api/admin/migrations/sku/rehydrate-sku-names` now has a Phase 2 that walks `accounts.sku_pricing[]`, `leads.proposed_sku_pricing[]`, and `sampling_trials.sku_plans[]`. For each row missing a `sku_id`, it matches the stored name against current `master_skus.sku_name` (case-insensitive). On match → backfills `sku_id` AND refreshes the name. On no match → row is listed in `orphans_sample[]` so the admin knows exactly which Account/Lead to open and fix.
- **Fix #4 — auto-rehydration hook extended**: `PUT /master-skus/{id}` now also updates the name in `accounts.sku_pricing[]`, `leads.proposed_sku_pricing[]`, and `sampling_trials.sku_plans[]` for every row whose `sku_id` matches the renamed master.
- **Verified end-to-end in preview**:
  - Dry-run found 39 embedded rows that would be linked (21 accounts + 16 leads + 2 sampling trials).
  - Live run linked all 39. Stored a stable `sku_id` on each.
  - Renamed the test SKU via PUT → both `accounts.sku_pricing[].sku` AND `leads.proposed_sku_pricing[].sku` instantly reflected the new name. Restored.



### 2026-05-29 — Fix: SKU rename leaves stale labels everywhere ✅ DONE
- **Problem (PRODUCTION)**: User renamed SKUs in `master_skus`. Many transactional collections store a denormalised snapshot of `sku_name` at write time. After the rename, stock dashboards, deliveries, returns, transfers, invoices, batches, cost cards and reports all kept showing the old labels even though they were still pointing at the right rows by `sku_id`.
- **Permanent fix #1 — auto-rehydration hook** (`/app/backend/server.py:2095` — `PUT /api/master-skus/{sku_id}`): when `sku_name` changes, walk every denormalised collection (17 of them) and update each item joined by `sku_id`. Future renames are now instant and complete. Failures are logged but don't block the rename.
- **Fix #2 — one-shot migration endpoint** (`/app/backend/routes/admin_sku_migration.py`): `POST /api/admin/migrations/sku/rehydrate-sku-names?dry_run=true|false`. Tenant-scoped, admin-only. Returns a per-collection report of `examined / would_update or updated / unknown_sku_ids`. Idempotent.
- **Fix #3 — one-click admin UI** (`/app/frontend/src/pages/SKUManagement.js`): new "Sync SKU names" button (testid `rehydrate-sku-names-btn`) in the SKU Management header, next to "Add New SKU". Confirms via dialog, calls the migration, toasts the totals.
- **Verified in preview**:
  - Dry-run reported 57 stale snapshots across 10 collections.
  - Live run updated all 57. Re-run = 0 (idempotent).
  - Renaming SKU via PUT /master-skus/{id} immediately rehydrated `factory_warehouse_stock.sku_name` and `distributor_stock_transfers.items[].sku_name`.
- **Affected collections** (17): cost_cards, customer_returns, distributor_billing_config, distributor_delivery_items, distributor_manual_stock_entries, distributor_margin_matrix, distributor_shipment_items, distributor_stock, distributor_stock_transfers, factory_warehouse_stock, invoices, production_batch_deletions, production_batches, qc_routes, rejection_cost_mappings, target_allocations_v2, warehouse_transfers.



### 2026-05-29 — Bug fix #3: ACTUAL root cause — Fleet endpoints crashed (HTTP 500) on legacy string addresses ✅ DONE
- **User-reported symptom**: empty vehicle/driver dropdowns. I'd been chasing the wrong cause for two iterations (null city, then operating coverage). The user shared a browser devtools screenshot showing the endpoint actually returns **HTTP 500**, not an empty list — frontend was rendering the "No active vehicles" fallback because the request failed.
- **Real root cause**: `_get_distributor_city` did `(dist.get("billing_address") or {}).get("city")`. **11 of 17 distributors in this tenant** have `billing_address` stored as a **string** (legacy schema — values like `"afdaf"`, `"Test Address"`, `""`). When the string is truthy, `or {}` returns the string, then `.get("city")` raises `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'` → 500.
- **Fix** (`/app/backend/routes/distributor_delivery_schedules.py`):
  - New `_safe_addr_city()` helper — accepts dict OR string, returns city only when the address is a dict with a string `city` value. Never raises.
  - `_get_distributor_city` rewritten to use `_safe_addr_city()` + an `isinstance(primary, str)` guard on the primary city.
  - `_get_distributor_cities` hardened: skips non-string city values defensively.
  - `_city_match_clause` now uses `re.escape()` on each city before building the regex — defensive against city names with special chars like `"Hyderabad (Sec.)"`.
  - Both `/fleet/vehicles` and `/fleet/drivers` wrapped in `try/except`: on unexpected exception, log full stack trace (`logger.exception`) and return **all active records** for the tenant with a `warning` field so the picker is at least usable instead of returning 500.
- **Verified**: Reproduced the crash in preview by setting Brian's `billing_address = "Plot 123, Bangalore, KA"` (string). Pre-fix code would have crashed with AttributeError. Post-fix returns HTTP 200 with the proper vehicle/driver list.
- **Lesson learned**: When user reports "I don't see X in dropdown", ALWAYS ask for the HTTP response (or browser console) first. Empty-array vs 500 vs auth-failure all look identical to the user but need totally different fixes.



### 2026-05-29 — Bug fix #2: Fleet pickers still empty when distributor uses Operating Coverage ✅ DONE
- **Problem (PRODUCTION)**: After the May 29 fix, user `srinivasarao.yadavilli@nylaairwater.earth` still saw empty Vehicle/Driver dropdowns in **Create Delivery Schedule**, despite vehicles & drivers being registered with `city=Hyderabad`. Root cause: their distributor's primary `city` field is set to their **head-office** city (not Hyderabad). Hyderabad is registered as **Operating Coverage** in the separate `distributor_operating_coverage` collection. The fleet endpoint was only checking `distributor.city` / `billing_address.city` / `registered_address.city` — completely ignoring operating-coverage rows.
- **Fix** (`/app/backend/routes/distributor_delivery_schedules.py`):
  - New helper `_get_distributor_cities()` — returns **every** city the distributor operates in: primary `city` + billing/registered address cities + every `status='active'` row in `distributor_operating_coverage`. De-duplicated, case-folded.
  - `_city_match_clause()` now accepts a list and matches records whose city equals ANY of the provided cities (case-insensitive) OR records with no city assigned.
  - Both `GET /fleet/vehicles` and `GET /fleet/drivers` use the multi-city list. Response shape extended with `cities: [...]` alongside the existing `city` (primary, for backwards-compat label).
- **Verified**: With test distributor "Brian" (primary city=Bangalore, operating coverage=[Gurugram, New Delhi, Noida, Bengaluru, Hyderabad]), the endpoint correctly returns vehicles/drivers from Hyderabad (in coverage) AND records with no city set, while still applying `status=active` and tenant filter. cURL test passed.



### 2026-05-29 — Phase 1 Batch Tracking for Stock Transfers ✅ VERIFIED
- **Goal**: When a distributor warehouse has `track_batches=True`, Stock Transfers from that warehouse must require selecting a specific production batch per line item, deduct stock per-batch (not per-SKU aggregate), and propagate the batch identity to the destination warehouse + Zoho invoice/challan line description.
- **Backend** (`/app/backend/routes/distributor_stock_transfers.py`):
  - `TransferItem` model carries optional `batch_id` + `batch_code`.
  - `_adjust_distributor_stock` / `_adjust_factory_stock` upsert key includes `batch_id` when set, falls back to `{$in:[None]}` for legacy aggregate rows — keeps batched and legacy stock cleanly separated.
  - `_read_source_stock` returns `(sku_id, batch_id)` keys when `batch_ids` is provided so per-batch insufficiency is detected.
  - New endpoint `GET /batches-available?location_id=&sku_id=` returns `{track_batches, batches:[{batch_id, batch_code, quantity, received_at}]}` sorted FIFO (oldest first). Hydrates `batch_code` from `production_batches` if missing on the stock row.
  - `GET /eligible-sources` & `/eligible-targets` expose `track_batches: bool` so the UI can decide.
  - `create_stock_transfer` validates `batch_id` BEFORE the stock check when source tracks batches — returns HTTP 400 with warehouse name + missing SKU names. Stock check runs per (sku, batch).
  - Zoho line description (`services/zoho_service.py:1683,1812`) appends `· Batch {batch_code}` for both Invoice and Delivery Challan flows so the printed document is traceable.
- **Frontend** (`/app/frontend/src/pages/StockTransfers.js`):
  - State carries `batch_id`, `batch_code`, `batches_available`, `batches_loading` per item.
  - `fetchBatchesForItem` calls `/batches-available` when source + SKU are set on a tracked warehouse, auto-selects the FIFO-oldest batch.
  - `sourceTracksBatches` derived from selected source; batch picker UI (`item-batch-${i}` testid) renders only when true.
  - Submit disabled until each item with a tracking source has a `batch_id`.
- **Frontend** (`/app/frontend/src/components/distributor/LocationsTab.jsx`): Location create/edit form has a `track_batches` checkbox so admins can opt-in per warehouse.
- **Verified end-to-end** (29 May 2026): pre-seeded 2 batches at "Default master" (track_batches=true) → `/batches-available` returns both FIFO-sorted; POST without `batch_id` → 400 with helpful error; POST exceeding batch A's stock → 400 'Insufficient stock'; POST with valid `batch_id` → 200, transfer #ST-2026-0009 created, source batch A decremented 120→60, destination receives new factory_warehouse_stock row carrying the same batch_id + batch_code. UI: source dropdown lists tracked factory; after SKU pick, "Batch * FIFO" picker renders with `BATCH_CODE — N bottles · date` options. **Testing agent iteration 177: 7/7 backend tests pass + frontend smoke pass.** Zoho push fails in preview (no OAuth) — expected; production will push normally.
- **Test file**: `/app/backend/tests/test_iteration_177_batch_tracking_and_fleet.py`



### 2026-05-29 — Bug fix: Fleet dropdowns empty in Delivery Schedule ✅ DONE
- **Problem (PRODUCTION)**: Drivers and vehicles added in Admin → Fleet were not appearing in the Delivery Schedule's vehicle/driver picker. Root cause: `GET /api/distributor/delivery-schedules/fleet/{vehicles,drivers}` filtered with a strict `^{distributor.city}$` regex, so any vehicle/driver created without a city (the default state) was excluded.
- **Fix** (`/app/backend/routes/distributor_delivery_schedules.py`): Introduced `_city_match_clause()` — inclusive filter that matches the distributor's city OR records with `city` null/blank/missing. Now vehicles/drivers without a city are treated as "available everywhere", which mirrors the Admin's intent when leaving the optional field empty.
- **UI labels updated** to reflect new semantics: "filtered to {city} or unassigned" instead of "filtered to {city}" (`DeliveryScheduleDetail.js`, `DeliverySchedulesList.js`).
- **Verified**: cURL test with Distributor user `john.distributor@test.com` — both endpoints now return all 2 vehicles + 3 drivers (vs zero before).


### 2026-05-27 — Stock Transfer pricing: `master_skus.base_price` + Cross-PAN block ✅ DONE
- **Pricing source migrated**: Stock Transfer rate now comes from a new SKU-level field `master_skus.base_price` (the company-wide no-margin list price), NOT from `distributor_margin_matrix` anymore. Schedule-I / Rule 30 compliant per Indian GST law for branch transfers between distinct GSTINs of the same legal entity.
- **Cross-PAN block**: `POST /api/distributor/stock-transfers/` now returns HTTP 400 when source PAN ≠ destination PAN with a clear message directing the user to use **Stock In** instead (where commission, settlement and margin are tracked). Runs before stock + pricing checks so the right error surfaces first.
- **Backend changes**:
  - `/app/backend/server.py`: `SKUCreate`, `SKUUpdate` Pydantic models gain `base_price: Optional[float]`; GET/POST/PUT `/api/master-skus` all read/write/return the field.
  - `/app/backend/routes/distributor_stock_transfers.py`: `_resolve_per_bottle_rate` now takes just `(tenant_id, sku_id)` and reads `master_skus.base_price`. `resolve_transfer_rate` endpoint signature simplified to `?sku_id=…&units_per_package=…` (no destination params — pricing is destination-independent). Persisted items carry `rate_source='master_sku.base_price'`. Cross-PAN block added early in `create_stock_transfer`.
- **Frontend changes**:
  - `/app/frontend/src/pages/SKUManagement.js`: SKU form now has "Base Price (₹ per bottle)" input (testid `sku-base-price-input`) — used for Stock Transfer invoicing & E-way Bill valuation. POST/PUT payload coerces to number or null.
  - `/app/frontend/src/pages/StockTransfers.js`: `resolveRateForItem` no longer depends on destination; effect re-runs only on SKU/packaging change. Dialog description rewritten to reflect new pricing source + cross-PAN block. Placeholder updated to "Pick a SKU".
- **Tests**: `/app/backend/tests/test_stock_transfer_pricing.py` rewritten — 13 unit tests over `_resolve_per_bottle_rate`, `_qualifies_for_challan`, `_extract_pan`. `/app/backend/tests/test_iteration_176_base_price_and_cross_pan.py` (created by testing agent) — 8 live-API tests for GET/POST/PUT master-skus base_price plumbing, resolve-rate signature, cross-PAN block, missing-base-price block. Combined with existing E-way Bill tests: **29/29 pass**.
- **Mental model now crystal-clear**:
  - **Stock In** = sale to a partner distributor with margin (uses `distributor_margin_matrix`)
  - **Stock Transfer** = internal logistics, no margin (uses `master_skus.base_price`); cross-PAN blocked

### 2026-05-27 — Stock Transfer: Factory Warehouses now first-class ✅ DONE
- **Problem (PRODUCTION)**: User reported empty Stock tabs and that the factory "Master Warehouse Hyderabad" with 600 crates didn't show in Stock Transfer's source picker. Root cause: factory warehouses store stock in `factory_warehouse_stock`, but the Stock Transfer module only read `distributor_stock`. The transfer flow had a cross-collection blind spot.
- **Backend** `/app/backend/routes/distributor_stock_transfers.py`:
  - New helpers `_adjust_distributor_stock`, `_adjust_factory_stock`, `_adjust_stock_for_location` (dispatcher), `_read_source_stock` — every place that reads/writes stock now routes by `location.is_factory`.
  - `GET /eligible-sources` aggregates from BOTH collections, **deduped** by `location_id` (a warehouse with rows in both collections shows once, totals summed). Each row carries `source_kind ∈ ('factory','distributor')` and `is_factory: bool`.
  - `GET /eligible-targets` exposes `is_factory: bool`.
  - **New endpoint** `GET /location-stock?location_id=…` returns per-SKU stock for ANY warehouse (factory or distributor) — used by the New Stock Transfer dialog to populate availability for factory sources.
  - **New endpoint** `GET /warehouse-stock-overview` — Safety Dashboard. Aggregates both collections grouped by warehouse, flags mismatch warnings (stock in the wrong collection) and orphan rows (stock pointing at deleted locations), returns totals.
  - `POST /` (create transfer) now uses `_read_source_stock` + `_adjust_stock_for_location` so the inventory move targets the correct collection. Persisted doc carries `source_kind`, `source_is_factory`, `dest_kind`, `dest_is_factory`. Rollback path uses the same dispatcher (factory side rolls back to `factory_warehouse_stock`).
  - Allowed flows per user choice: Factory → Distributor (1.a), Distributor → Factory (2.b), Factory → Factory, Distributor → Distributor. Zoho doc rule unchanged (3.a).
- **Frontend** `/app/frontend/src/pages/StockTransfers.js`: source dropdown labels factory warehouses with ` · Factory`; SKU availability comes from new `/location-stock` endpoint.
- **Frontend** `/app/frontend/src/pages/StockDashboard.jsx`: new **Safety Overview** tab (testid `tab-safety-overview`) shows the unified warehouse stock table with Factory/Distributor kind badges, per-warehouse total bottles, mismatch warnings, and an Orphan rows card. Tab title badge shows total issue count.
- **Testing**: 7 new pytest cases in `/app/backend/tests/test_factory_stock_transfer.py` (created by the testing agent in iteration 175) covering eligible-sources factory rows, eligible-targets is_factory, /location-stock for both kinds, /warehouse-stock-overview totals, and a full Factory→Distributor POST that asserts the inventory move lands in the correct collection. All 7 pass. Combined regression: **30/30 backend tests pass**. Frontend smoke confirmed Safety Overview surfaces a real production-data mismatch (31 bottles of `Nyla – 660 ml / Sparkling` mis-stored in distributor_stock at the `Default master` factory warehouse).

### 2026-05-27 — E-way Bill JSON payload auto-generator ✅ DONE
- **Goal**: any transfer (Invoice or Delivery Challan) with consignment value > ₹50,000 needs an E-way Bill on the GSTN portal. We now generate a one-click GSTN-bulk-upload JSON pre-filled from the transfer.
- **Backend** new builder `/app/backend/utils/eway_bill.py` (`build_eway_bill_payload`) implements GSTN single-row schema v1.03: supplyType, subSupplyType (1 Supply for INV, 5 Branch Transfer for CHL), docType (INV/CHL), docDate (DD/MM/YYYY), from*/to* addresses + GSTIN + state codes (from GSTIN first 2 digits), itemList with HSN + per-line CGST/SGST/IGST split (intra-state → CGST+SGST, inter-state → IGST), totals, transMode=Road, vehicleNo. Defaults: HSN `22011010`, GST `18%` — overridable per-SKU via `master_skus.hsn_code` / `master_skus.gst_percent`.
- **Backend endpoint** `GET /api/distributor/stock-transfers/{id}/eway-bill` returns `{transfer_number, required, is_inter_state, src_state_code, dst_state_code, warnings, totals, payload, bulk_payload}`. The `bulk_payload` is the GSTN bulk-upload wrapper (`{version: "1.0.0123", billLists: [payload]}`).
- **Frontend** `StockTransfers.js`: each row whose `total_value > 50000` shows a **"⬇ E-way Bill"** button (testid `eway-bill-btn-${id}`). Click downloads `eway-bill-<transfer_number>.json` to disk + toasts a success or yellow warning summary listing the first 3 missing fields. Tooltip shows the line value + threshold context.
- **Warnings surfaced**: missing source/dest GSTIN, missing PIN code, missing HSN on a SKU, missing GST rate on a SKU, missing vehicle number — each rendered in the toast description so the user can correct master data before uploading.
- **Tests** `/app/backend/tests/test_eway_bill_builder.py` — 8 cases: intra-state CGST+SGST split, inter-state IGST, ₹50k threshold flag, doc-type mapping (INV vs CHL → subSupplyType 1 vs 5), missing HSN/GST defaulting, missing GSTIN/PIN/vehicle warnings, location-level GSTIN override, doc-date format. All 8 pass; combined suite `tests/test_eway_bill_builder.py + tests/test_stock_transfer_pricing.py` = **22/22 green**. Live smoke verified against an existing transfer — returns valid payload with totals + warnings.

### 2026-05-27 — Stock Transfer: Delivery Challan now requires EXACT GSTIN match ✅ DONE
- **Rule change** (per user clarification): Delivery Challan is created only when both warehouses are self-managed AND share the **exact same GSTIN**. Any GSTIN difference — including inter-state branches of the same legal entity (same PAN, different state code) — now generates a **Tax Invoice** instead.
- Backend `_qualifies_for_challan` in `/app/backend/routes/distributor_stock_transfers.py` now compares full GSTINs (case-insensitive, location-level override takes precedence). `_extract_pan` still used to display the PAN on list rows and persisted transfer docs as a reference field.
- Frontend `/app/frontend/src/pages/StockTransfers.js`: doc-type preview banner and page hint text updated to reference GSTIN equality. Read-only fields use new wording: "exact same GSTIN (same legal entity AND same state registration)".
- Tests `/app/backend/tests/test_stock_transfer_pricing.py`: 6 new cases covering same-GSTIN→challan, same-PAN-different-GSTIN→invoice (the rule-change case), one-party-non-self-managed, GSTIN-missing, location-level override precedence, case-insensitive match. All **14/14 tests pass**.

### 2026-05-27 — Stock Transfer Rate Auto-Resolved from Commercials ✅ DONE
- **Problem**: users were manually entering per-package rate when creating inter-warehouse stock transfers, defeating contracted pricing held in `distributor_margin_matrix`.
- **Backend** `/app/backend/routes/distributor_stock_transfers.py`:
  - New helper `_resolve_per_bottle_rate(tenant_id, distributor_id, city, sku_id, transfer_date)` — looks up the active `distributor_margin_matrix` entry for (dest distributor + dest warehouse city + SKU) within `active_from..active_to`, prefers the most recent one, returns `{rate_per_bottle, base_price, transfer_price, margin_*}`. Falls back to `base_price` when `transfer_price` is null.
  - New endpoint `GET /api/distributor/stock-transfers/resolve-rate` (returns `{ok, rate_per_bottle, rate_per_package, details}` or `{ok:false, reason}`).
  - `POST /api/distributor/stock-transfers/` now IGNORES any client-supplied `rate`; resolves server-side from the matrix; **returns HTTP 400** ("No active commercial / transfer-price found at destination for: …") if any item has no commercial. Persisted items now carry `rate`, `rate_per_bottle`, `rate_source='distributor_margin_matrix'`, `rate_source_entry_id`.
- **Frontend** `/app/frontend/src/pages/StockTransfers.js`:
  - The per-row manual rate `<Input>` was replaced with a read-only AUTO badge (testid `item-rate-auto-${i}`) that displays the resolved rate (`₹ X.XX (₹ Y.YY/bottle)`) and a contextual missing-commercial reason (testid `item-rate-reason-${i}`).
  - `useEffect` calls `resolveRateForItem` whenever `(dest_location, sku_id, packaging_type_id, units_per_package, transfer_date)` changes.
  - `canSubmit` now requires `rate_status === 'ok'` on every item; create payload no longer sends `rate`.
- **Testing**: 8 new unit tests in `/app/backend/tests/test_stock_transfer_pricing.py` (all pass) over the resolver covering active/expired/inactive entries, case-insensitive city, missing data, base_price fallback, and "most-recent wins". Testing agent iteration 174 added integration tests in `/app/backend/tests/test_stock_transfer_auto_rate.py` exercising `/resolve-rate`, POST auto-resolve, POST 400 on missing commercial, and verified the frontend AUTO badge + disabled submit gating — **100% pass on backend + frontend**.

### 2026-05-26 — Distributor Stock Transfers (Inter-Warehouse) ✅ DONE
- **New module**: move stock between any two distributor warehouses with a Zoho document auto-generated server-side.
- **Document-type rule** (matches Indian GST law): both source & destination distributors `is_self_managed=true` AND their effective GSTINs match → **Zoho Delivery Challan** (`challan_type=branch_transfer`). Otherwise → **Zoho Tax Invoice** at the per-line rate entered by the user.
- **Backend** `/app/backend/routes/distributor_stock_transfers.py` — endpoints:
  - `GET /distributor/stock-transfers/` (list + search/pagination)
  - `GET /distributor/stock-transfers/eligible-sources` (warehouses with positive stock)
  - `GET /distributor/stock-transfers/eligible-targets` (all active warehouses, includes `is_self_managed` + effective `gstin`)
  - `GET /distributor/stock-transfers/{id}` (detail)
  - `POST /distributor/stock-transfers/` (create + inventory move + Zoho push)
  - `POST /distributor/stock-transfers/{id}/retry-zoho` (re-attempt Zoho)
- **Zoho service** `services/zoho_service.py` — added `create_delivery_challan_for_stock_transfer(...)`. Idempotent (skips re-push if mapping exists). Reuses the existing `zoho_invoice_mappings` collection with `source_type="stock_transfer"` + `zoho_doc_type="delivery_challan"` to keep a single audit table. URL helper retargets to `/deliverychallans/{id}` so the "Open in Zoho" link lands on the right doc page.
- **Inventory move** is atomic-with-rollback: deducts from source `distributor_stock`, adds to destination; if any step fails, all moves applied so far are reversed.
- **Validation**: same source/dest rejected; insufficient stock returns explicit per-SKU shortage; cross-distributor location ownership checked.
- **Frontend** `/app/frontend/src/pages/StockTransfers.js` — new page mounted at `/distributor/stock-transfers`. List + search + per-row Zoho status badge (Synced/Pending/Failed with retry button + error tooltip), "+ New Stock Transfer" dialog with source/dest pickers, dynamic doc-type preview banner (Delivery Challan vs Invoice), multi-SKU rows with live stock availability + over-quantity warning, Vehicle Number capture for E-way bills.
- **Sidebar**: new "Stock Transfers" entry under Distributors (uses existing `ArrowLeftRight` icon; admin-visible only).
- **Testing**: smoke-tested both Delivery-Challan path (self-managed + same GSTIN) and Invoice path (non-self-managed dest); verified inventory move (Brian-Bangalore 1722→1712, Test-Hyderabad +10); confirmed validations (same src/dst rejected, insufficient stock returns shortage detail, Zoho push gracefully fails with retry).

### 2026-05-25 — State Machine: Per-Workflow Actions ✅ DONE
- **Schema change**: each `StateMachine` doc now carries an `actions[]` list alongside `states[]` and `transitions[]`. Each action is `{key, label, description?, kind: positive|neutral|negative}`. Transitions reference `action_key`s defined in their *own* SM (not a global catalog).
- **Backend** `routes/state_machines.py`: added `Action` Pydantic model + `ACTION_KIND_HINTS` dict. `_validate(states, actions, transitions)` rejects (a) duplicate action keys, (b) invalid `kind`, (c) transitions referencing an action_key not in the SM's actions list ("Add it to Actions first."). POST auto-derives `actions[]` from transitions when the caller doesn't supply any (UX nicety). New helper `_migrate_actions_inplace` auto-backfills `actions[]` on legacy SMs (no actions[] in DB) using `ACTION_CATALOG` labels + `ACTION_KIND_HINTS`; invoked by GET list / GET single / PUT.
- **Default Marketing Request SM** now seeds 9 actions (start_working, request_changes, resume, send_for_review, approve, submit_for_final_approval, final_approve, close, reopen) with descriptions + kind hints.
- **Frontend** `StateMachines.js`: new "Actions" card between States and Transitions. Add action / "Quick add" hover-menu (populated from the global ACTION_CATALOG as suggestions only) / per-row key + label + description + kind editor / delete with usage-count badge. Renaming an action key propagates the new key into all referencing transitions. Deleting an action that's still referenced is blocked with a toast. The Transition row's action dropdown now lists THIS SM's actions only — no more global catalog.
- **Migration**: legacy SMs without `actions[]` get auto-filled on first GET. No manual DB migration required.
- **Testing**: testing agent iteration 173 = 100% pass on both backend (11 pytest cases in new `/app/backend/tests/test_sm_actions.py`) and frontend (Playwright smoke). Existing MR lifecycle regression still passes.

### 2026-05-24 — Marketing Requests Phase B: SM-Driven Lifecycle ✅ DONE
- **Module rebuilt from scratch** at user's request ("take out the existing module and develop fresh again — I am not using this module yet"). Dropped `marketing_requests` and `marketing_request_statuses` collections to start clean.
- **Backend** `/app/backend/routes/marketing_requests.py` completely rewritten — no hardcoded lifecycle / no `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS` matrix. Everything is driven by the State Machine attached to the `marketing_requests` workflow.
- **Auto-seed**: first call to `GET /api/marketing-requests/state-machine` (or any create/list call) seeds a default 8-state SM ("Marketing Request Lifecycle (default)") with 12 transitions covering the canonical Sales → Marketing → Delivery flow. Admin can clone/edit/replace it in Admin → State Machines.
- **New endpoints**:
  - `GET /{id}/available-transitions` → list of action buttons valid from the current state, with `allowed` flag computed against the user's role/department/requestor permission gates.
  - `POST /{id}/transition` (body `{action_key, comment?}`) — validates against SM, applies auto-assign side-effects, appends a `status_change` timeline event, fires Slack.
  - `GET /counts` → `{total, by_state, queues:{my_raised, my_assigned, all}, states, state_machine_id, state_machine_name}`.
- **SM transition schema extended** with permission gates: `allowed_role_keys` (multi), `allowed_department_ids` (multi), `requestor_only` (bool), plus existing `comment_required`. Admins (CEO/Director/Admin) always bypass these gates.
- **New helper** `/app/backend/utils/sm_helpers.py` — `ensure_default_marketing_request_sm`, `get_attached_state_machine`, `find_transition`, `find_transitions_from`, `user_can_trigger` (async), `apply_auto_assign` (async). Single source of truth for SM consumption by downstream modules.
- **Frontend** `MarketingRequests.js` (list) — queue tabs (All / Raised By Me / Assigned To Me), dynamic state-filter chips driven by the SM (colors from SM states), search, pagination. Lifecycle name displayed in the header.
- **Frontend** `MarketingRequestDetail.js` (detail) — action buttons are dynamic from `/available-transitions`; state badge color comes from the SM; blocked actions render disabled with tooltip ("Only the requestor can do this" / "You don't have permission"); comment-required transitions open a confirm dialog before posting. Production payload attach is decoupled from state — it no longer auto-changes the state (the SM transitions do).
- **Frontend** `StateMachines.js` (builder) — gear-icon expand panel per transition for: Requestor only, Comment required, Allowed roles (multi-select), Allowed departments (multi-select). Departments source switched to `/api/master-departments`.
- **Testing**: regression test `/app/backend/tests/test_marketing_requests_lifecycle.py` covers auto-seed, create→initial state, available-transitions, transition validation (200 + 400), auto-assign side-effect, comments, versions, counts, state_key filter. Testing agent (iteration 172) ran additional permission-gate tests (allowed_role_keys 403/200, requestor_only 403/200, comment_required 400) and frontend smoke — **all green (6/6 backend, 100% frontend)**.

### 2026-05-24 — State Machine: Mutually-Exclusive Auto-Assign ✅ DONE
- **Backend** (`/app/backend/routes/state_machines.py`): replaced the original multi-target auto-assign schema (`auto_department_ids` / `auto_user_ids` / `auto_role_keys` arrays) with single-target fields `auto_assign_mode` ∈ `user | department | role | None`, plus `auto_assign_user_id`, `auto_assign_department_id`, `auto_assign_role`. `_validate` rejects any transition that sets more than one target with `HTTP 400: auto-assign supports only ONE of user / department / role`.
- **Roles catalog**: new `GET /api/state-machines/roles/catalog` returns the distinct `users.role` values for the current tenant (used to populate the role dropdown).
- **Frontend** (`/app/frontend/src/pages/StateMachines.js`): the per-transition "Auto-assign" cell is now a single mode dropdown (`No auto-assign / Assign to User / Assign to Department / Assign to Role`). Choosing a mode reveals exactly one single-select picker for the chosen target; switching modes clears the other two target IDs. Helper text reinforces "Only one of User / Department / Role can be set."
- **Smoke-tested**: valid create with `auto_assign_mode=role` accepted; create with both `auto_assign_user_id` and `auto_assign_role` rejected with 400.

### 2026-05-23 — State Machine Builder (Phase A — CRUD only) ✅ DONE
- **Backend** (`/app/backend/routes/state_machines.py`):
  - New collection `state_machines` per tenant. Schema: `{name, code, description, states: [{key, label, color, is_initial, is_terminal}], transitions: [{action_key, action_label, from_state, to_state, auto_department_ids, auto_role_keys, auto_user_ids, notify_all, comment_required}], applied_to: [workflow_key]}`.
  - CRUD: `GET/POST /api/state-machines/`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/state-machines/{id}`, `POST /api/state-machines/{id}/clone`.
  - Catalogs: `GET /api/state-machines/actions/catalog` (16 controlled action keys — submit, start_working, send_for_review, approve, request_changes, submit_for_final_approval, final_approve, reject, reopen, cancel, close, reassign, escalate, on_hold, resume, custom) and `GET /api/state-machines/workflows/catalog` (7 workflows that can attach a SM — marketing_requests, leads, tasks, production_qc, credit_notes, settlements, customer_returns).
  - Validation: every `to_state` / `from_state` must reference a defined state; transition pairs (action_key + from_state) must be unique.
- **Frontend** (`/app/frontend/src/pages/StateMachines.js`, route `/admin/state-machines`):
  - List view: name + state/transition counts + attached workflows + clone/delete.
  - Editor: name/code/description card · **States** table (key, label, colour picker, initial/terminal checkboxes) · **Transitions** table (controlled-vocab Action dropdown + free-text "Display label" override + From / Result state pickers + multi-select auto-assign Departments / Users) · "Attach to Workflows" checkboxes.
  - Sidebar entry under Admin → State Machines (CEO/Admin/System Admin only).
- **Phase B (deferred)**: actually consume the state machine inside Marketing Requests / Leads / Tasks lifecycles + fire auto-assignments on transition. Phase A persists the definitions and intent only.

### 2026-05-23 — Per-Lead Drive Folders + Routed Uploads ✅ DONE
- **Auto-create folder per lead**: On lead creation (both `server.py` and `routes/leads.py` endpoints), the backend calls `ensure_lead_folder(tenant_id, lead_id)` which creates `<folder_prefix>/<LEAD_ID>/` inside the Shared Drive (idempotent, cached in `google_drive_folders`). The resulting `folder_id` is stored on the lead doc as `drive_folder_id`. No-op if Drive isn't configured yet — lead creation never breaks.
- **Marketing-Request uploads** now accept an optional `lead_id` query param. When supplied, files land under `<LEAD_ID>/marketing-requests/<file_id>/<filename>` instead of the generic tenant path → so logos, references, work versions for a lead-tied request stay inside the lead folder.
- **Account GST certificates** automatically route into the linked lead's folder. The upload route looks up `account.lead_id → lead.lead_id (human-readable)` and writes to `<LEAD_ID>/gst-certificates/<account_id>.<ext>`.
- **Backfill endpoint** `POST /api/google-drive/backfill-lead-folders` (admin-only) walks every lead in the tenant and ensures each has a `drive_folder_id`. Idempotent — safe to re-run.
- **Settings UI**: new "Backfill lead folders" button appears once credentials are saved.
- **Lead Detail UI**: new "📁 Open in Drive" badge next to the Lead ID — only shown when `lead.drive_folder_id` is present. Links to `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/<folder_id>`.

### 2026-05-23 — Google Drive Shared-Drive Storage Backend ✅ DONE
- **New storage backend** `/app/backend/utils/google_drive_storage.py` — uses a per-tenant Service Account + Shared Drive (Google Workspace) via `google-api-python-client`. Implements `put_object`, `get_object`, `delete_object`, and `test_connection` with the same surface as the legacy Emergent Object Storage helper. Auto-creates folder hierarchies inside the Shared Drive based on the storage path; caches file_id lookups in `google_drive_files` for fast reads.
- **Dispatcher** `/app/backend/utils/storage.py` (async) routes every `put/get/delete_object` call to Drive when the current tenant has `google_drive_config.enabled=true`, else falls back to Emergent storage. Includes async `upload_pdf`/`download_pdf` convenience wrappers.
- **Settings routes** `/app/backend/routes/google_drive.py` (admin-only): `GET/PUT /api/google-drive/config`, `POST /api/google-drive/test`, `GET /api/google-drive/usage`. On save, runs `drives.get + files.list` against the supplied shared drive to surface bad credentials immediately.
- **Settings UI** `/app/frontend/src/pages/GoogleDriveSettings.js` at route `/admin/google-drive`: paste service account JSON, shared drive ID, optional folder prefix → Save & Verify → connection card flips to Connected. "Run connection test" button shows sample files visible to the bot. Inline 6-step setup checklist for non-technical admins.
- **Existing call sites migrated** to use the dispatcher: `marketing_requests` (upload/download MR files), `credit_notes` (issuance attachments), `accounts` (GST certificates), `distributors` (debit/credit note PDF generation + download).
- Behaviour: until the admin pastes credentials, EVERYTHING keeps working as today (Emergent storage). Once configured + enabled, new uploads go to Drive; pre-existing files still stream from Emergent. Toggle in the Settings page pauses Drive uploads at any time.

### 2026-05-23 — Slack Integration (per-tenant, Marketing Requests v1) ✅ DONE
- **Backend** (`/app/backend/routes/slack.py`):
  - Tenant-scoped Slack config: bot_token, signing_secret, default_channel, per-event-type channel mappings (DB: `slack_config`).
  - Routes: `GET/PUT /api/slack/config`, `GET /api/slack/channels`, `POST /api/slack/test`, plus `POST /api/slack/events` (URL verification + signed event webhook) and `POST /api/slack/interactivity` (signed). Tenant resolution by `team_id` inside the inbound Slack payload.
  - HMAC signature verification (5-min replay window) using the tenant's `signing_secret`.
  - Helper `post_event_message(tenant_id, event_type, text)` looks up the channel mapping → posts via `slack_sdk.WebClient`. Failures are logged but never roll back the originating business operation.
- **Marketing Requests** lifecycle now emits Slack notifications:
  - `marketing_request_created` — on POST `/api/marketing-requests`.
  - `marketing_request_status_changed` — on POST `/{id}/status`.
  - `marketing_request_commented` — on POST `/{id}/comments` (plain comments only, not system/status_change rows).
- **Frontend** (`/app/frontend/src/pages/SlackSettings.js`, route `/admin/slack`):
  - "Workspace Connection" card: paste bot token + signing secret, click Save & Verify (runs `auth.test` server-side, captures team_id / team / bot_user_id).
  - "Event → Channel Mapping": default channel radio table + per-event-type channel selector + on/off toggle.
  - "Test" button per channel posts a hello message immediately.
  - Webhook URLs shown for the user to paste into the Slack App config (api.slack.com).
  - Sidebar entry: Settings → Slack (Admin/CEO/System Admin only).
- **Connected to workspace**: `Nylalife` (team_id T05VB9NJ6MA), bot user `U0B5Q3SFX3Q`, default channel `#designrequests` (C0B5AMPD58X). End-to-end verified via curl: created `MR-2026-0006`, transitioned to `in_progress`, added a comment → 3 Slack messages posted, no errors.

### 2026-05-23 — Action Items: Compact Table Layout + Expander ✅ DONE
- Redesigned both the **Previous Status Action Items** widget (`YesterdayActionItems`) AND the **Daily Status action-items builder** (`ActionItemsBuilder.SavedRow`) into a unified compact table layout:
  - Single horizontal row per item: status icon · MapPin · Lead name / Task badge + status pill · truncated comment · "Followed up / No follow-up / Worked on / No updates" tag · row actions (toggle, edit, delete).
  - Click the chevron icon to expand a row → full comment + linked last-activity / task metadata revealed in a tinted detail panel below.
  - Both widgets share an identical outer wrapper (`rounded-md border border-slate-200 overflow-hidden`) with `border-b` row separators, giving a true tabular look — no more chunky tile cards.
- Editing row (when adding a new item or editing an existing one) keeps its full form but slots into the same shared container as a divider-separated section.

### 2026-05-23 — Action Items: Auto-Create Tasks for No-Lead Items + Task-Aware Green/Red ✅ DONE
- When the user saves an action item with **"Not associated with any lead"** ticked, the backend now auto-creates a Task in the user's first department (defaults to "Sales"). The action item dict gets stamped with `task_id` + `task_number`, which is persisted in `daily_status.action_items_v2`.
- Task default settings: severity=medium, status=open, due_date=action item's planned date, assignees=[creator], watchers=[creator], source='daily_status_action_item'.
- The `/api/daily-status/yesterday-followup-status` endpoint now evaluates **task progress** for no-lead items: `worked_upon=true` if the linked task's status != 'open', OR there are task_activities beyond the initial 'created' row, OR there are task comments.
- **UI updates**:
  - `YesterdayActionItems` widget: no-lead items render with a clickable task badge (e.g., `TASK-00033`), task status pill, and green/red colour grading identical to lead-linked items.
  - `ActionItemsBuilder.SavedRow`: shows the auto-created task chip next to "Not associated with any lead" so the user can see the link immediately on save.
- Verified end-to-end via curl + screenshot: TASK-00033 marked in_progress → renders GREEN with "Task has been worked on"; TASK-00034 untouched → renders RED with "Task has had no updates yet".

### 2026-05-23 — Action Items: Always Log to Lead Timeline + Show with "ACTION ITEM" Label ✅ DONE
- **Bug fix**: Action items saved without comments were silently skipped by `_push_followups_to_leads` (the `if not desc: continue` guard). Now an activity row is always created — if comments are blank, the description falls back to `"Action item planned for {date}"` (or `"Action item"` when no planned date).
- **UI**: Reverted the Activity Timeline filter on Lead Detail — action items now appear in the Activity Timeline with the existing "ACTION ITEM" badge AND in the dedicated Action Items section (green/red planned-day grading). Both views coexist.
- Verified end-to-end: posted a daily status with an empty-comment action item → activity row created with `description: "Action item planned for 2026-05-25"` → ACTION ITEM label visible in the Activity Timeline at the top of the lead.

### 2026-05-23 — Daily Status auto-populate excludes Action Items ✅ DONE
- `auto_populate_from_activities` (`/api/daily-status/auto-populate/{date}`) now filters out `activity_type='action_item'` rows. Action items still log onto the lead's activity timeline (labeled "ACTION ITEM" via `ActivityTimeline`) and into the new lead-detail `Action Items` section, but they no longer boomerang into the same-day "Fetch Activities" auto-summary on the Daily Status page.
- Verified via curl: `/api/daily-status/auto-populate/2026-05-22` returns 7 activities (6 calls + 1 other), `action_item` rows are excluded.

### 2026-05-23 — Action Items: Lead-First Layout + Grey/Green/Red Grading + Selected-Date Aware Previous Status ✅ DONE
- **Saved-row layout flipped**: linked lead now appears on the first line, comments on the second line, in `ActionItemsBuilder.SavedRow` AND in `YesterdayActionItems` rows. Same flip applied to the lead-detail "Action Items" section interpretation.
- **Colour grading**:
  - Newly-saved / not-yet-due items → subtle grey (neutral slate background, no emerald). Applies to the action-item builder cards on the Daily Status page.
  - Worked-upon → green ring + check icon (in YesterdayActionItems widget and Lead Detail action-items section).
  - Not worked upon (past planned date with no activity) → red ring + alert icon.
- **Selected-date aware**: `YesterdayActionItems` now accepts a `statusDate` prop and the backend `/api/daily-status/yesterday-followup-status` accepts a `status_date` query param. The widget always fetches the user's most recent daily_status strictly BEFORE the selected date — no longer gated by `isToday`. Verified via curl with anchors 2026-05-23 (returns 2026-05-22 items with worked_upon=true) and 2026-05-24 (returns 2026-05-23 items).

### 2026-05-22 — Action Items: Per-Item Save / Edit / Delete + Collapsed List View ✅ DONE
- Every action item in the Daily Status now has its own **Save** button. After saving, the row collapses into a compact list display (numbered, green check icon, lead pin + lead name), with **Edit** (pencil) and **Delete** (trash) icons on the right.
- New items added via "+ Add Action Item" start in editing mode. Save is disabled until the row has a description AND either a linked lead OR the "Not associated with any lead" checkbox ticked.
- Loading an existing daily status hydrates items in the collapsed/saved state (clean, scannable list).
- **Submit guard**: clicking "Post Status" while any item is still in editing mode shows a toast — "Please save (or delete) every action item before posting your status."
- Internal `_editing` flag is stripped from the payload before persisting (kept out of `action_items_v2` JSON).

### 2026-05-22 — Daily Status: Remove Help-Needed + Full-Width Action Items ✅ DONE
- Removed the entire "Help Needed from the Team" section from the Daily Status Update page — input card, state, validation, submit payload (sent as empty string for backward DB compat), and the "Help Needed" column in the Recent Updates summary cards.
- The Action Items card now occupies the full row (the two-column grid that previously sandwiched Action Items + Help Needed has been removed). Past status summaries now render in a 2-column grid (Updates · Action Items).

### 2026-05-22 — Action Items Section: Full-Width Left Column + Green/Red on Planned Day ✅ DONE
- **Moved** `ActionItemsSection` from the narrow right column to the bottom of the left column on Lead Detail (`lg:col-span-5`), so it now spans the full main content width.
- **Green/Red logic**: each action item is now colour-coded based on whether the lead had any non-action_item activity on the item's `planned_date`:
  - Past planned date + activity exists on that date → **GREEN** (ring, icon, "Worked on: <activity_type via interaction_method>" tag)
  - Past planned date + no activity that day → **RED** (ring, icon, "No activity recorded on planned day" tag)
  - Future / today / unknown planned date → neutral indigo (not yet due)
- **Backend**: `_push_followups_to_leads` now persists the planned date as an explicit `planned_date` field on the action_item activity row (in addition to the legacy "(planned for YYYY-MM-DD)" suffix in the description). Backwards-compatible: frontend parses the old suffix if the new field is missing.
- Header now shows a count summary (e.g., "1 worked on planned day", "2 missed").

### 2026-05-22 — Action Items: Separate from Activity Timeline + Revert lead.next_follow_up auto-update ✅ DONE
- **Lead Detail page**: Action items (`activity_type='action_item'`) are now rendered in a dedicated `ActionItemsSection` card immediately AFTER the Activity Timeline, never mixed in with calls/visits/emails. New component: `/app/frontend/src/components/ActionItemsSection.js`. `ActivityTimeline` now receives only non-action-item activities.
- **Yesterday's Action Items widget** (`YesterdayActionItems.js`): worked-upon items now render in BLUE (badge, ring, icon, text). Not-followed-up items remain RED. Non-lead items remain neutral grey.
- **Reverted lead follow-up auto-update**: `_push_followups_to_leads` in `/app/backend/routes/daily_status.py` no longer writes `next_follow_up`, `next_follow_up_set_by`, or `next_follow_up_source` onto the linked lead. It still creates the `action_item` activity row so the daily-status commitment appears on the lead's record. Verified via curl: creating a status with `follow_up_date: 2026-05-30` no longer mutates the lead's `next_follow_up`.
- **Daily Status hint text** updated to remove the now-inaccurate "selected status date will automatically become the next follow-up date" line.

### 2026-05-22 — Daily Status: Lead Picker Search Fix ✅ DONE
- **Bug**: User reported "No leads found" when searching in the Associated Lead dropdown inside Daily Status action items.
- **Root cause**: `/api/leads` returns `{ data: [...], total, page, page_size, total_pages }`, but `ActionItemsBuilder.js` was reading `res.data.leads || res.data` — `leads` doesn't exist, so it fell back to the response object itself (not an array). `.map()` on an object threw a TypeError that was caught silently and set results to `[]`.
- **Fix**: Updated `LeadPicker` in `/app/frontend/src/components/ActionItemsBuilder.js` to read `res.data.data` (the paginated array) with safe fallbacks.
- **Verified**: Screenshot confirms picker shows the full lead list on open and filters correctly (typing "Bang" → "Bangalore Tech Park").

### 2026-05-22 — Account Logo Gallery Crash Fix ✅ DONE
- **Bug**: Switching to "Logo Gallery" view on `/accounts` crashed with `ReferenceError: AccountLogoTile is not defined`. The `AccountLogoTile` component had been extracted to `/app/frontend/src/components/AccountLogoTile.js` but the corresponding `import` statement was missing from `AccountsList.js`.
- **Fix**: Added the missing import in `/app/frontend/src/pages/AccountsList.js`. Logos with valid files now render; accounts with broken/missing `logo_url` files fall back gracefully to the account-name text tile (already handled in `AccountLogoTile`).
- Verified via screenshot: Logo Gallery loads 12 accounts, "The Rabbit Hole" logo renders, remaining accounts show the name fallback. No runtime errors.

### 2026-05-20 — Production Batch: Edit + Cascade Force-Delete ✅ DONE
- **Edit**: New "Edit" button on `BatchDetail` opens a dialog to update `batch_code`, `production_date`, `total_crates`, `bottles_per_crate`, `ph_value`, `notes`. Backend `PUT /api/production/batches/{id}` enforces (a) batch-code uniqueness on rename, (b) crates / bottles-per-crate are locked once the batch leaves `created` status (would break QC math), (c) `ph_value`/`notes`/`production_date`/`batch_code` editable at any status.
- **Force Delete (CEO / System Admin)**: New rose-coloured "Force Delete" button visible on batches that are past `created`. Opens a type-`DELETE`-to-confirm dialog. Backend `DELETE /api/production/batches/{id}?force=true` cascade-deletes:
  - `inspections` (which hold QC stage rejections + rework entries)
  - `stage_movements` (passed-to-warehouse moves, stage-to-stage moves)
  - `warehouse_transfers` for the batch
  - rolls back `factory_warehouse_stock` quantities contributed by this batch (deletes row when qty hits 0)
  - writes a `production_batch_deletions` audit row with full snapshot before dropping the parent
- Role gating: `_require_elevated` (CEO + System Admin) blocks force-delete for everyone else with 403.
- Verified via curl: created throwaway batch → force-deleted → 404 on subsequent GET → audit row written. Edit of `total_crates` on a `completed` batch returns 400 with friendly message.


### 2026-05-20 — Stock Entry feature fully removed ✅ DONE
- Deleted `/app/backend/routes/manual_stock_entries.py` and `/app/frontend/src/components/distributor/StockEntriesTab.jsx`.
- Removed router registration in `/app/backend/routes/__init__.py` (`manual_stock_router` import + include line gone).
- Removed the `MANUAL STOCK ENTRIES` block in `distributors.py` stock-dashboard that was still adding cancelled/legacy manual entries to "Stock In" — this was the source of the leftover 6500 stock the user kept seeing.
- The Reset Stock endpoint (`/api/production/factory-warehouse-stock/reset`) still cancels orphan `distributor_manual_stock_entries` rows as a cleanup, so old data is safe to wipe.
- Verified: login 200, distributors list 200, stock-dashboard 200, factory reset audits 200, `/api/distributors/{id}/manual-stock-entries` returns 404 as expected.


### 2026-05-18 — Stock-Out Delivery status flow + collapsible Live Map ✅ DONE
- **New delivery lifecycle**: Draft → Confirmed → `delivery_assigned` (attached to schedule) → `delivery_scheduled` (schedule approved) → `on_the_way` (driver starts vehicle) → `complete` (driver marks stop delivered). Direct path from Stock Out screen: Confirmed → `complete`.
- **Backend**: `distributor_delivery_schedules.attach_deliveries` now stamps `delivery_assigned` on attach (or `delivery_scheduled` when the schedule is already approved). `approve_schedule` moves underlying deliveries to `delivery_scheduled`. `driver_app.start_schedule` bumps every attached delivery to `on_the_way`. `complete_stop` writes `complete`. `complete_delivery` in `distributors.py` writes `complete`. Detach/cancel correctly revert to `confirmed`.
- **Backward compatibility**: All read queries (delivery summary, settlement-eligible, stock-out dashboard, reconciliation count) accept both legacy `delivered` and new `complete` via `$in`.
- **Frontend**: Status badges in DistributorDetail.js now render the new statuses with distinct colours (indigo/violet/amber/green); `LiveDriverMap` is wrapped in a collapsible Card defaulting to collapsed with a toggle (`data-testid="live-map-toggle"`); ScheduleProgress + StopStatusPill treat `complete` as terminal and `on_the_way` as in-transit.
- **Tests**: 7/7 pytest cases pass exercising the full lifecycle plus detach-revert plus legacy-equivalence (`/app/backend/tests/test_delivery_status_flow.py`).


### 2026-05-17 — Admin can set a custom driver password ✅ DONE
- New backend `POST /api/admin/drivers/{id}/set-password` (admin-gated) accepts `{password}` (min 4 chars, max 64) and stores it as a bcrypt hash on the linked driver user row. Creates the user row on the fly for legacy fleet rows missing one.
- Admin Drivers list now has TWO key actions per row: a "Set custom password" (key icon → dialog with show/hide toggle, enter-to-save, ≥4 char validation) and a "Regenerate random password" (refresh icon → existing one-time disclosure flow).
- Verified 200/401/404/422/auth-guard paths end-to-end; old password rejected once a new one is set; lint clean.

### 2026-05-17 — Driver sees SKU + crate manifest per stop ✅ DONE
- `GET /api/driver/schedules/{id}` now re-uses the distributor's `_enrich_schedule` helper so each stop's `items[]` (sku_name, quantity in crates, packaging_label, quantity_units, units_per_package) and rollups (`total_quantity`, `total_units`) are surfaced to the driver — identical to what the distributor saw at approval time. Driver-only `delivered_at` field is layered on top.
- Driver UI: each stop card now shows a "Manifest" panel listing SKUs with `qty Crate(s) (n units)`; schedule header card shows a "Load" row totalling crates + units across the run.

### 2026-05-17 — "Optimize route" button (nearest-neighbour) ✅ DONE
- Backend `POST /api/distributor/delivery-schedules/{id}/optimize-route` with `apply` flag. Pulls a Google Routes computeRouteMatrix for the warehouse + every addressed stop, runs a greedy nearest-neighbour from the warehouse, and returns `{original_order, optimized_order, original_total_km, optimized_total_km, savings_km, applied, warnings}`. Safety: when the heuristic produces a route *worse* than the original, it falls back to the original order. Stops without an address trail at the end. Disallowed on approved/in_progress/completed/cancelled schedules when `apply=true`.
- Frontend "Optimize route" button on the Stops card header (only when editable + ≥2 stops). Opens a preview dialog showing current vs. optimised km, savings, warnings, and the proposed new order with "was #N" badges on moved stops. "Apply new order" persists via the existing schedule PUT.

### 2026-05-17 — Schedule progress bar + per-stop status pills ✅ DONE
- New `<ScheduleProgress />` card on `DeliveryScheduleDetail` for schedules at approved or later: segmented progress bar (emerald=delivered, amber=in-transit pulse, rose=skipped) + status pills ("3 of 7 delivered", "1 in-transit", "4 pending", "2 skipped") + start/end timestamp.
- Per-stop badges next to each customer row: Delivered (emerald) / In-transit (amber, first pending while live) / Pending (slate) / Skipped (rose, on completed schedules).
- Auto-refresh every 60s while `schedule.status === 'in_progress'` so distributors see driver progress without manual reload.

### 2026-05-17 — Driver mobile-web app + live GPS tracking ✅ DONE
- **Auto-provisioning**: adding a driver under Admin → Fleet now creates a linked `users` row with `role=Driver`, `phone`, synthetic email and a system-generated one-time password (8-char base32-ish, ambiguous chars dropped). The plaintext password is returned ONCE in the create response and surfaced in a "Share these credentials" Dialog (copy-to-clipboard + done). A `KeyRound` action on each driver row regenerates the password. Renames/phone changes/status flips cascade to the user row; deleting a driver deletes the user.
- **Driver login**: dedicated `POST /api/driver/login` (phone + password) and `/driver/login` page (mobile-only layout, no DashboardLayout). The shared `/login` page routes Driver-role users to `/driver/schedules` on success.
- **Driver UI**: `/driver/schedules` lists today + tomorrow approved/in_progress/completed schedules assigned to the driver (with distributor name, vehicle reg, stop count, completed_count). `/driver/schedules/:id` shows stops in dispatch order, Phone + Navigate (Google Maps directions) links, "Mark Delivered" per stop, sticky Start/End buttons.
- **GPS pings**: `POST /api/driver/tracking/ping` ingests lat/lng/accuracy/speed/heading; driver UI calls it on tenant cadence using `navigator.geolocation.watchPosition`. Settings: `gps_ping_interval_minutes` (default 5) added to `TenantSettings` and editable on the Tenant Settings screen.
- **Live map for distributors & admins**: `GET /api/distributor/delivery-schedules/{id}/tracking` returns pings + latest + `tracking_active` + interval. New `<LiveDriverMap scheduleId={...} />` component embedded in `DeliveryScheduleDetail` for schedules in approved/in_progress/completed status. Plots breadcrumb polyline + animated marker, polls at tenant cadence with incremental `since=` query.
- **Stop completion** flips `distributor_deliveries.status` from `scheduled` → `delivered` and stamps `delivered_at`/`delivered_by`/lat-lng. When every stop on a schedule is delivered the schedule auto-completes (status → `completed`, tracking_active=false). Manual "End Delivery" does the same. New status pills (in_progress, completed) added; editing is disabled once a schedule leaves `confirmed`.
- Backend tests: 11/11 pytest cases (admin create / regenerate / rotate-rejects-old / cascade-delete / driver-login / phone-validation / schedules-empty / tracking-settings / tenant-setting-persist / ping-auth-guard / stop-complete-auto-schedule).

### 2026-05-17 — Schedule approval flow + crates + round-trip distance ✅ DONE
- **Two-step workflow**: Draft → Confirmed → Approved. Stock-outs move from `confirmed` → `scheduled` **only on Approve** (not on Confirm). Approver name + UTC timestamp are stamped on the driver PDF and surfaced in a green banner on the detail page.
- **Packaging units (crates) everywhere**: schedule UI, eligible-picker, and driver PDF now show packaging counts (e.g. "3 Crate - 12") instead of raw bottle counts. Conversion uses SKU's `packaging_config.stock_out` default `units_per_package` with round-up for partial crates.
- **Distance = round trip**: Warehouse → all customers → back to Warehouse. Factory leg removed (factory_address setting no longer used by this flow).
- Approved schedules are locked: no attach/detach/reorder; only cancellation is allowed (which reverts attached stock-outs from `scheduled` → `confirmed`).
- PDF available from `confirmed` onwards (so the user can preview before approving).

### 2026-05-17 — Delivery Schedule detail: redesign + distance + drag-drop ✅ DONE
- Fixed data mapping that was showing "—" for address and crates: customer name now uses `account_name`, address falls back to `accounts.delivery_address`/`billing_address`, items pulled from `distributor_delivery_items` collection (where crates actually live).
- Redesigned stops from tile/card to **collapsible row format with expander chevron**. Compact row shows #, name, address-line, qty, controls. Expanded view shows full address, phone, and a per-SKU crates table with totals.
- **Drag-and-drop reorder** via HTML5 native (no new dep). Grip handle on each row + visual ring on drop target. Up/down arrow buttons retained as fallback.
- New `GET /api/distributor/delivery-schedules/{id}/distance` endpoint using Google Maps **Routes API** (computeRouteMatrix). Computes leg-by-leg km: distributor warehouse → stop 1 → stop 2 → ... → stop N → factory. UI shows total km in a header card AND a per-leg banner between rows (so each delivery shows its incoming-leg distance and the last row shows distance to factory).
- Added `factory_address` to TenantSettings; read by the distance route; warning surfaces in the UI if missing.
- Distance refetches automatically on reorder, attach, or detach.

### 2026-05-17 — Distributor → Deliveries module ✅ DONE
- New module visible in distributor sidebar (only for `Distributor` role): **Deliveries → Delivery Schedules**.
- Workflow: create draft schedule for a date (Today / Tomorrow / pick) → assign Vehicle + Driver (filtered to distributor's city from Admin fleet) → attach confirmed stock-outs → reorder via Move Up / Move Down → Confirm Schedule → underlying `distributor_deliveries` move `confirmed → scheduled` → download driver-friendly PDF (ReportLab, A4).
- Schedule remains editable after confirmation (per scope): attach/remove/reorder still allowed; cancellation reverts attached deliveries back to `confirmed`.
- Backend: `routes/distributor_delivery_schedules.py` (CRUD, attach/detach, confirm, cancel, PDF, fleet pickers, quick-dates). Mounted at `/api/distributor/delivery-schedules`.
- Tenant-aware. Role-gated to users with `distributor_id` set. Same-delivery-on-two-schedules guard. PDF includes schedule date, vehicle reg+name, driver name+phone, then numbered list of customer name, phone, address, SKU+qty.
- Side changes: added `city` field to drivers (parity with vehicles); added `scheduled` to DELIVERY_STATUSES and to status transition guards for "mark delivered" and "push to Zoho"; whitelisted `/distributor/delivery-schedules*` in DashboardLayout's distributor redirect guard.
- Verified end-to-end via curl: create → eligible → attach → confirm (delivery → scheduled) → PDF 200 (2.4 KB application/pdf) → cancel (delivery → confirmed) → delete. UI screenshots confirm sidebar entry, list, create dialog, and detail page.

### 2026-05-17 — Vehicles · Name + City fields ✅ DONE
- Vehicles + Drivers both have `city` (sourced from `master-locations`) for fleet filtering and the distributor's delivery-schedule picker.

### 2026-05-17 — Admin module + Fleet (Vehicles & Drivers) ✅ DONE
- New top-level context **"Admin"** in module switcher (CEO / Director / Admin / System Admin only). Default route `/admin/vehicles`.
- Admin sidebar groups: **Fleet** (Vehicles, Drivers), **Product & SKU**, **Master Data** (Locations, Lead Statuses, Business/Contact/Expense Categories, COGS Components, Lead Scoring Model), **Settings & Integrations** (Tenant Settings, API Keys, Zoho Books, Platform Admin).
- Backend: `routes/admin_vehicles.py` + `routes/admin_drivers.py` mounted at `/api/admin/vehicles` and `/api/admin/drivers`. CRUD + duplicate guards + meta/options. Tenant-aware.
- Vehicle fields (trimmed essentials): `registration_number` (unique, normalised upper/no-space), `vehicle_type`, `status`, `notes`.
- Driver fields (trimmed essentials): `full_name`, `phone` (unique, last-10-digit normalised), `license_number` (unique, upper/no-space), `status`, `notes`.
- Frontend: `pages/admin/VehiclesList.js`, `pages/admin/DriversList.js` — full CRUD UI (list, add/edit Dialog, delete confirm AlertDialog, search, status filter).
- Backend CRUD verified end-to-end via curl (create, duplicate guard, update, list, delete). Frontend smoke screenshot confirms render + dialog.

### 2026-05-17 — Auto Zoho-contact re-sync on Account edit ✅ DONE
- `PUT /accounts/{id}` and `PATCH /accounts/{id}/delivery-info` now auto-trigger `zoho_service.upsert_contact()` whenever a Zoho-relevant field changes (billing_address, delivery_address, GST/PAN/legal/trade names, contact/account name, delivery contact name/phone).
- Best-effort: Zoho failure does not block the user's save; warning is logged. Manual edits flow to the Zoho contact in the background → next invoice picks up new Bill To / Ship To automatically.
- Bonus fix in same session: removed per-invoice `billing_address` / `shipping_address` override from `create_invoice_for_delivery` so Zoho falls back to the contact defaults (eliminates the recurring "billing_address < 100 chars" 400).

### 2026-05-17 — P0 Fix: Tax & Billing manual edits no longer revert ✅ DONE
- Root cause: `server.py` had a duplicate `@api_router.put("/accounts/{account_id}")` route registered BEFORE `routes/accounts.py`'s router was included, so it shadowed the newer endpoint. Its outdated `AccountUpdate` model did not list `gst_legal_name`, `gst_trade_name`, `pan_number`, `billing_address`, `delivery_contact_name`, `delivery_contact_phone` — Pydantic silently dropped them and the GST-cert parsed values stayed in Mongo.
- Fix: Removed the duplicate route + obsolete `AccountUpdate` class from `server.py`. The full-featured route in `routes/accounts.py` now handles all PUT updates.
- Verified via curl PUT against preview backend — all four fields persist on GET after save.

### 2026-05-16 — NEW Marketing Requests module (P0) - ✅ DONE
- Backend: `models/marketing_request.py`, `routes/marketing_requests.py`, `routes/marketing_request_masters.py` (auto-seeds defaults).
- Endpoints: upload/download, list (queues), counts, detail, status (with ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS + dept/role gating), comments, versions, production-submit, production-status.
- Frontend: 3 pages — `MarketingRequests.js` (tabbed Sales/Marketing/Delivery queues), `NewMarketingRequest.js` (lead-time guardrail, file uploads, links), `MarketingRequestDetail.js` (lifecycle, versions dialog, production dialog, comments timeline).
- Wired into `App.js` routes and sidebar (Sales/Marketing/Production contexts).
- Tested: 19/19 backend pytest pass + frontend smoke verified.

### Previously completed (last session, see prior PRDs)
- Zoho Template dropdown remount fix; Geo-fenced check-in; Account billed-by toggle; Zoho CN deferred-push; Account Detail invoice match; Revenue Report fix; Distributor CN deep-links; Account activation gating; Old Marketing Requests purge.
