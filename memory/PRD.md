## What's Been Implemented

### Feb 19, 2026
- **BUG FIX**: Lead creation form now validates region field properly
  - Root cause: Form used `user.territory` ("All India") which backend rejected
  - Fix: Added `getInitialRegion()` validation + frontend required field checks
  - Status: VERIFIED - All tests passed

- **BUG FIX**: Lead Discovery import not saving leads
  - Root cause: Silent failures in import loop, no per-item error handling
  - Fix: Added individual error tracking, accurate success/failure counts
  - Added "Re-import All" feature for updating existing leads
  - Status: VERIFIED - MTR lead imported successfully

- **BUG FIX**: Imported leads not showing in Leads list
  - Root cause: 40+ older leads had NULL `lead_id` (showing as "-" in table)
  - Fix: Ran database backfill script to generate lead_ids for all existing leads
  - Also fixed 3 leads with missing city field
  - Status: VERIFIED - All 59 leads now have proper Lead IDs

- **BUG FIX**: "Session expired" error during Lead Discovery import
  - Root cause: Redundant /api/auth/me call that could fail
  - Fix: Use AuthContext for user data, use centralized leadsAPI
  - Status: VERIFIED

- **FEATURE**: Implemented Server-Side Pagination
  - Root cause: Previous limit of 100 leads was not scalable
  - Fix: Full server-side pagination with PaginatedLeadsResponse model
  - Backend returns total count, current page, and page_size
  - Frontend fetches only current page with debounced search
  - Status: VERIFIED - Works with 63 leads across 3 pages

- **FEATURE**: Implemented Backend APIs for Performance Dashboards
  - Created `/api/reports/sku-performance` endpoint
    - Returns SKU-wise targets, achieved revenue, units sold, leads count
    - Supports filters: time_filter, territory, state, city, resource_id, sku
  - Created `/api/reports/resource-performance` endpoint
    - Returns resource-wise targets, achieved, leads, won deals, visits, calls
    - Supports same filters plus resource filtering
  - Added `get_time_filter_dates()` helper for date range calculations
  - Updated frontend pages to use auth tokens
  - Status: VERIFIED - Both dashboards showing real data

### Previous Session (from handoff)
- Resolved critical Babel/dev server error (craco.config.js fix)
- Dashboard navigation overhaul (single dropdown menu)
- Created SKU Performance and Resource Performance pages (MOCK DATA)
- Redesigned Sales Overview page (chart-less, card-based)
- Standardized SKUs and Partner-Sales role logic
- Fixed CORS configuration for deployment
